' VR Room Mods, implementation of Fleep sounds, dynamic shadows, and other features for Version 2.0 by UnclePaulie
'   Testing and feedback provided by Rawd, PinStratsDan, Rothbauerw, Bord, Apophis, Sixtoe, Fluffhead, Wylte, Remdwaas, and RIK

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.0 by UnclePaulie *********
' - Added all the VR Cab primatives (Used from Defender VR and Space Shuttle VR, as similar Williams Table); adjusted as appropriate
' - Matched cabinet colors for flipper buttons (normally black, but also over a metal side rail, so made them red)
' - Score alphanumeric displays and code Used from Fathom VR Table and rearranged
' - Backglass Image from Hauntfreak's B2S file... Note:  ONLY the image.  The rest of display done in code.
' - Added plunger primary and code for movement
' - Added two different VR room environments
' - Moved ball shadows back under the apron, as you could see them in VR
' - Added GI to backglass
' - Ramp 15 and 16 removed
' - Rotated the 10 lane triggers 180 degrees, lowered the suface height by 8, and changed the width to 0.75; except for sw46
' - Moved the lane triggers forward to align with plywood holes
' - Rotated the million triggers to 190 to align with plywood hole insets better.  Also moved sw26 foreward a little to align.
' - SW46 moved down a bit, made visible, and changed wire thickness to 0.1
' - Changed playfeild shadow layers to z height of .03 to avoide a z fighting issue.
' - Added an apron Wall
' - Moved the plunger back a little, so ball sits right before launch.  Also increased mechanical strength to 1.2
' - Changed the ball image and added jp_scratches for decal to enhance the ball rolling realism
' - Increased light intensity from 14 to 100 for the four down lanes (1986)... they were a little hard to see through back ramp.
' - Increased the z height of the plastics_prim to 4 (from 0).  The white peg holders and screws were too high, and needed to move a little.
' - Sixtoe made one mod to the bumper material to be plastic with image opacity.  Made the bumpers look more realistic
' v1.1: Added the interactive backglass (game over, tilt, ball in play, etc.).  Primary and several flashers were added GI was added for backglass light flashers

'******** Revisions done by UnclePaulie on Hybrid version 0.1 - 2.0 *********
' v0.1: Enabled desktop, VR, and cabinet modes
'     Added LUT options with save option (all modes)
'     Added lighter ball images provided by hauntfreaks and g5k ball scratches, changeable in script
'   Added an optional VR Clock,
'   Animated the plunger, flippers, and start button for VR mode
'   Glass and scratches options added for VR mode (Rawd solution).  Not used for cab or desktop
'   Added new image for desktop mode backglass.
'   Updated VR backglass to have dynamic off color for LED displays
' v0.2: Added interactive flashers to backglass for VR
' v0.3: Enabled show mesh on the lights on layer 6.  This looks better in VR.
'   Added plywood holes under sling1 and 2.  Changed sling1 and 2 to better primitives.  More realistic, and hang below playfield.
'   Changed flipper buttons to yellow, like real table.
' v0.4: Added Fleep Sounds (part implemented), nFozzy / Roth physics and flippers.
'   Added VPW Dynamic Ball Shadows to the solution done Iakki, Apophis, and Wylte
'   Increased the visibility of the dynamic ball shadows.
'   Bord provided updated flippers, plunger, and playfield friction
' v0.5: Fleep Sounds finished with Bord's physics primitives
' v0.6: Replaced drop target to the solution done by Rothbauerw, also enabled drop target shadows.
'     Updated ramprolling sounds by fluffhead35 as well as ballroll and ramproll amplication sounds
'   Made the plastics collidable to prevent a bounced ball from going in.  (not sure if needed, but just in case large ball bounce.)
' v0.7  bord - bumped flipper strength slightly, added Roth's flipper dampening script (replaces Rubberizer)
' v0.8  Added a wall near the drop target and standup target.  Wylte found a corner condition that if the ball slow rolls near target after drop is dropped, it pops up through plastic, or could get stuck behind target.
'   The wall still allows it to pop above the plastic, but doesn't fall behind, so play continues.  Mostly a corner condition.  Might add something more...
' v0.8a Changed the desktop text to EM Reels to prevent not seeing correctly on 4k monitors.  Bord provided advice based off @scottacus prior solutions
' v0.9  Added wall 0.1 under playfield by flippers to prevent ball from dropping below playfield when ball hung on an end of flipper.  (rothbauerw suggestion)
'   Added Ramp shooter lane grooves and ball release wall to better emulate ball in shooter lane (rothbauerw suggestion)
'   Adjusted the friction, elasticity, and falloff of the corcscrew ramp to just allow the ball to go through from a right flipper cradle.  (should be hard, not impossible)
'   also had to bump the flipper strength up slightly to get ball up corkscrew.
'   Adjusted friction of plastic ramp slightly.  Ball went a little too fast on it.
' v0.10 Added code to correct corner condition where ball can get stuck on corkscrew. (Rothbauerw provided code)
'   Changed z height of metalrails_prim to 0.5.  There was a slight z fighting issue with the playfield.
'   Increased height of physical wall of plastic ramp by 25.  Corner condition, one time ball jumped over the ramp when entered really fast.
' v0.11 Adjusted the height of the rubbers on posts slightly for better visual placement.
'   Moved outerwalls_prim forward by one vp unit.  Slight "Y" fighting visual issue on back wall.
' v0.12 Added an optional topper for VR.  Thanks to JoePicasso for the image.
'   Fixed issue with rabbit bonus being collected when coming out of million ramp (thanks Rothbauerw for fixing, and PinStratsDan for finding)
' v0.13 Added a difficutly setting for the left outlane post.  IRL, it can be moved to help nudge the ball back into the playfield.  (thanks to PinStratsDan for finding)
' v0.14 Added additional tweaks to the backglass in VR.
' v0.15 Removed collidable on window glass on layer 11.
'   RIK found an issue with rabbit collection bonus not working.  Corrected issue in sw24_UnHit and sw25_UnHit removing bsSaucer calls
' v0.16 Rawd mentioned that tilt sensitivity for keyboard nudging takes too many times to enable.  Changed sensitivity to 1.
'   Removed original gate3.  Ball rolled out weird.  (RIK, Wylte helped)
'   Added a visible gate (you can see a gate IRL).  Adjusted gate4 postion and size.  This was essential to getting the ball to come out correctly.
'   Changed friction of right ramp to 0.275.  It slowed down too much going up. (RIK)
'   Adjusted the saucer24 kickout angle, force, and variability.  It wasn't coming out correctly, should come out to right flipper slowly
' v0.17 Changed the windowglass on layer 11 to a toy as it seemed it was still colliding with the million ramp shot.
'   Lowered the elasticity of gate4 to .45.  Better bounce and slightly more variable roll out of gate.
' v2.0  Official Release
' v2.1  Astronasty indicatd that there was a flipper nudge code update needed, as the ball would hover, or get atypical bounces or roll too far on flippers.  It was recently done on Indy.
' v2.2  Rothbauerw suggested changing the height of the invisible playfield flipper wall to .01.  It''ll avoid the slight nudge Astronasty reported
' v2.3  Herwah noticed the plunger trigger activated when the plunger pulled back, not when ball releasd.  Trigger in wrong location.  Moved back 10 vp units.
'     Put the million ramp to friction of .285.  Still could get corner condition of the ball to jump slightly over.
