'******** Revisions done by UnclePaulie on Hybrid version 0.1 - 2.0 *********
' v0.1  Added hybrid mode for VR room, cabinet, and desktop
'   Added a rails material1VR to turn off active for VR mode.  The rail light reflections were bad in VR.
'   Added a different backwall primitive for VR.  It was too high.
'   Animated the flippers, start button, and plunger in VR
' v0.2  Animated the backglass in VR
'   Added an optional topper in VR
' v0.3  Added Updated/more recent Roth/nFozzy physics and Flipper physics and Fleep Sounds
'     Added dynamic shadows
'   Added updated ramprolling sounds
'   Modified shape of Light8, as it was very bright and reflected on side wall.
'   Added option for desktop/cab users to remove significant "glow" on rails
'   Added additional ball options without the ball reflectivity, as well as a couple brighter balls from hauntfreaks
'   Reduced reflection of playfield on ball from 6 to 0.5
'   Changed depth bias on Prim6 and 7 to 100.  Huge glow on middle transparent plastics
'   Adjusted the height and rotation of metal triggers.  Too high and incorrect rotation... could really see in VR.
'   Changed the rubber physics guide right of the right sling to a physics wall.
' v0.4  Adjusted physics on bumpers to hit threshold of 1.6, scatter 2.
'   Adjusted physcis on slings.  They weren't the same.  Made the same and adjusted to zCol_Slings:
'   Slight update to playfield friction to better match VPW, and some of Flupper's.
'   Adjusted flipper strength to 2600.
'   Adjusted VR Metalshiny material to check metal material
'   Adjusted shapes of some of the inset lights on layer 2 slightly, as you could see edges in VR.  Needed to align better with the text flasher.
'   Added a black side image material to the apron walls, so you can't see through in VR.
'   Added a upper plyfield VR wall just under the playfield to block being able to see the ball through the insets when on lower playfield.
'   Adjusted the plunger pull speed, as it was too slow
'   Adjusted GI22b,10,9,11 from 25 to 10.  Way too bright.
'   Changed intenisty of display lights on backglass for desktop mode from 3 to 0.8.  It was too intense/radiated.
'   Added code to adjust some light intensities based off cabinet mode or VR mode or desktop mode:  Too bright in VR and desktop, but looks good on cab.
'     GI34 from 40 to 25.  GI12,23 from 150 to 50.  Lights 25b,26b,27b from 400 to 200.  GI10,11,19,20 from 75 to 50
'   Cut holes in the playfield for the slings and the rollover targets.  Added plywood insets for more authentic look.
'   Added sling walls and new sling prim.
'   Adjusted the left sling rubber and top peg to the left to aling with actual table.
'   Adjusted UPPF wall slightly to not intersect the triggers (could see the Wall)
'   Added code to turn ransom off on vr and cab by default... unless a user specifies it...  Desktop always on.
'   Reduced the intensity of lights under slings for VR Mode
'   bumpertop2 had "render backfacing transparent checked.  Unchecked it and you can see though it now.
' v0.5  Added new drop targets by Rothbauerw
'   Added a couple screws to the sling plastics for realism.
'   Changed the live catch constant slightly for flipper physics realism
' v0.6  A few updates to material. Also adjusted the apron wall height down by 3 units.  You could see in the apron card.
'   Adjusted flipper coil ramp up to 2.5 (mode = 0).  Also changed rubberizer to 0... too bouncy on flippers.
'   Change LUT for cab vs VR.  cab = lut1.1.  VR is consat.
'   Flupper provided a new floor for VR.
' v0.7  Flippers were activating before and after game.  Made correction in keyup and down subs.
'   Added Flupper's original light intensities to cab_mode and desktop mode, unless user chooses to lower.  (VR mode is lower)
' v0.8  Reduced bloom strength for desktop and VR mode - issue mostly in desktop mode where ball had a huge glow over insertlights
'   Changed option for higher cabinet mode siderails
' v0.9  Updated VR backglass flashers to more closely match real backglass
' v0.10 Added option for bloom to be forced off in cabinet mode.
' v0.11 Changed ball default options for VR mode.  Added choice for default balls in all modes.
'   Changed rail textures for VR provided by Flupper.
'   A couple light intensities needed to be adjusted in the script.
' v0.12 Made _noextrashadingvr acitve
'   Fixed the "I" inset lighting... top wasn't showing.  Also fixed the falloff of the jackpot and ransom insets on UPF.  It was cutting off the edges of the insets.
'   Added grooves for plunger lane to emulate the ball sitting in the groove.  Adjusted BallRelease strength from 4 to 8 to get into groove.
' v0.13 Added a ballrealease wall for the kicker to help get onto grove.
' v0.14 Turned wirerampoff sounds off.  Fleep ramp sounds were enough.
'   Adjusted the kickback trigger forward to enable the kickback quicker. (thanks Rothbauerw for tip)
'   Adjusted the flipper size to 150 (thanks Rothbauerw for tip)
'     Reduced kickback timer to 300.  Stayed active too long.
' v0.15 Adjusted dynamic shadow code to eliminate stutter on some slower CPU machines.  Removed all getballs calls and changed to global gBOT
'   Changed the trough script to never delete balls.  The trough now updates like the real machine without destroying and creating new balls.
'     Added two walls to ensure ball launch goes into wire ramp.  Correcting corner condition where ball got inside table, behind back wall.
'     Adjustedthe WAR and extra ball inset lights slightly.  Could see some light leaks
' v0.16 Plywood cutouts were missing material.  Added.
'   Changed relay sounds to new Fleep sounds, and positioned for SSF.
'   Reduced the ballrelease strength.
'   Changed ballpopper, and reject saucer code and moved to Fleep sounds.
' v0.17 Removed vlock external call, and handled the upper lock code in the script.  Added Fleep sounds to those saucers.
'   Changed bk2000drawbridge motor to SSF.
'   Added Knocker to SSF
' v0.18 Changed dynamic sources to an array to improve performance for shadows
'   Adjusted the bottom WAR triggers on UPF down and a little smaller.
'   Set hit height of all triggers to 50.
'   Corrected sound of UPF Targets
'     Added ballrolling sounds to upper playfield
'   Corrected ramprolling sound on UPF.  It would continue if rolled back down UPF ramp.
' v0.19 Rothbauerw recommended updating the rubberizer code for more natural bounces.
' v0.20 Moved options up in script.
'   Couldn't hear drop target reset sounds, corrected.
' v0.21 Modified some of the drop target sounds to make a little more random sounds.
' v0.22 Corrected glowball code for new gBOT
'   Updated coordinates for CheckBallLocations
'
' v2.0  Release Version
' v2.0.1 Small dynamic shadows update.  The second DSSources is referencing 0 (X position) when it should be 1 (Y)
' v2.0.1 Added Magna Save button on the right, and animated it in VR.
'    retro27 Made some VR improvements including an alternate topper, a flyer, a power cord, side rail plates, and a couple other small VR tweaks.

' *** How to reduce jaggies on the wireramps or increase performance **********************
' The wireramps look best at 4K resolution with 4x MSAA; if you need more performance
' you can make the wireramps and wireguides "static" so they will have less jaggies without MSAA,
' but you will lose realtime reflections of the lights
' to do this, go to layer 2, select the wireramps and the wireguides (near the apron)
' and enable "static rendering"
