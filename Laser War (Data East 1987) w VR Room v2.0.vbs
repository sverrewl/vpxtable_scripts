'   Added groove to plunger lane, and small ball release ramp to get up.
'   Ensured all lights stayed within the playfield... could see lights outside of table in VR.
' v0.04 Moved the apron prim down from 75 to 20.  Was way too high.
'   Adjusted the VR cab Position
'   Aligned the triggers per the real table, and adjusted the height.  Also moved the plunger location slightly to the right to align correctly.
'     Added sideblades to DTRails.  Didn't look right in VR
'   Added a startbutton and animated it. Also animated plunger and flippers in VR.
' v0.05 Modified the flippers slightly for size, angle, and physics.  Similar to other VPW data east tables of that era, and matching photos.
'   Tweaked physics of bumpers and slings slightly.
'   Removed the "aphysics" materials and replaced with zCol_ physics
'   Finished adding physics primitives for posts, sleeves, gates, rubber bands, etc for Fleep sounds and VPW physics

'   Adjusted the playfield physics and general table settings.
'   Increased sling shot force a little stronger
'   Changed the sensor switches on the top left rubberbands to the new physics collidable wall ZCol_RubberBand007 and 9.
'   Adjusted the level of table difficulty from 5 to 6, and then set at 90% difficulty (= slope of 5.9).  (was set at only 6.2)
'   Added an adjustable kick variance to each saucer.  SW25 - changed variance to 0, and set power a little lower (10 to 8), and angle (180 to 200).
' v0.07 Added animated VR backglass and lighting. Also the VR Digits, and stereo image.
' v0.08 Adjusted the physical upper left wall by red saucer to ensure the ball rolls off correctly and onto the left flipper
'   There was an Iron Maiden Virtual Time mod done to this table.  Ensuring the ROM sound comes on with this table.
'   Slight adjustment of bumper force from 10 to 11, and hit threshold of 1.6 from 1.8.
'   Added updated ramprolling sounds solution created by nFozzy and VPW.
'   Added GI relay sounds
' v0.09 Added updated standup targets with VPW physics, original code created by Rothbauerw and VPW team
'   Adjusted the height of standup targets and hiddin bouncer walls.
'   Adjusted the ball brightness GI level, and ensured new stand up targets worked in GI
' v0.10 Added Flupper Domes.  Required removing significant portions out of initflasher sub, and other code mods.
'   Redid the VR Backglass flashers with new method.
'   Added dome flasher relay sounds, and adjusted volume of all relay sounds.
'   Adjusted the disablelighting of the flasher dome lights to fade with the same GI / GIStep like the rest of the table.
'   Made the flupper dome flare less bright.(from 0.3 to 0.1)
'   Adjusted the rubbers height up to align with posts.
'   In VR, you could see the 3 saucers light up through the walls. Changed material to active.
'   Put sensor walls in the holes between the posts in upper right side
'   Modified the backwall image slightly for around flasher domes
' v0.11 Added GI Bulb primitives (pBase,pBulb,pFiliment) to all the GI Bulbs.  The GI lights were a big "halo" in VR.
'   Added bulb bases for GI, added to a collection and adjust the material like rest of GI materials
'   Added option for desktop and cab sidewalls image (plywood or black)
'   Adjusted the cab pov.
' v0.12 Added plywood cutouts for the target, sling, and trigger holes.  Cut holes out of playfield.
'   Moved the flippers end angle to 68.  (was 65).  Was a little too high up.
' v0.13 Added 3D insert prims.  Updated the playfield for insert cutouts.  Added a text only ramp overlay.
'     Added Lampz in code
'   Removed the pflightscount routines. No longer needed.
'   Put the text image for inserts at alpha = 25
'   Adjusting light insert values: started with default values: falloff 50, falloff power 2, intensity 5, scale mesh 10, transmit 0.5.
'   Adjusted all the light colors
'   Adjusted the Lampz.FadeSpeedDown(x) = 1/20 (VPW default is 1/40).
'   Blue inserts were too bright, darkened the material for those.
'   Lots of insert lighting adjustments
'   Made the inserts fade faster, as hard to see blink.  Lampz.fadespeedup to 1/3 and speed down to 1/8.
'   Adjusted the inserts under the star triggers to look real.  Was just an image on playfield... now inserts.  Also the center explosion is an insert.
'   Added GI control to the new inserts under star triggers and explosion insert.
'   Changed the Playfield Material colors, and alpha level.  The overall colors weren't right.  Also adjusted day/night slider down some.
' v0.14 Some VR adjustments.
'   The WAR inserts needed to be increased, as well as yellow triangles.
'   Adjusted the insert blooms to different halo height, color, falloff, alloff power, intensity, speed, depth bias.
'   Added script to make the insert lights get brighter as GI gets darker
'     Adjusted insert light intensities: White = 8, Blue=8, Red=5, Green=5, Yellow=5, Star Trigger Inserts=3.5
' v0.15 Tomate fixed the primitives for the ramp and side curved metal walls. They didn't have correct faces, you can see through one side of them.
'   Adjusted two white insert prims intensity slightly down.
'   Adjusted the physics of the flippers slightly.  Also set the strenght at 2700.
' v0.16 Slight adjustment to bumpers, matching videos.
'     Updated the DMD speakers / stereo light image and added GI to it.
'   A couple minor lighting adjustments
' v0.17 Sixtoe corrected the upper right peg/rubber location based on actual laser war rebuild screen shots.  Corrected ball rolling down drain too easily.
' v0.18 Minor cleanups, and ensured VR checked to not visible.
'   Updated the material on Playfield Outlines to match playfield. (for the insert text)
'   Adjusted the slingshot force down down to 4 (was 5), based on VPW feedback.
'   Reduced the power of the kickback as well as it's randomness addition; based on VPW feedback.
' v0.19 Added updated slingshot corrections based off of Apophis example.  (Thanks AstroNasty for pointing out).
'   Moved physical wall, rMetalWall5, to match wall primitive and Sixtoe's corrected rubbers.
' v0.20 Based on AstroNasty's testing and feedback, I was able to see a couple ball bounce areas... one on left and right orbit.
'   Had to move rMetalWall5 a bit more and reshape it slightly.
'   Also had to adjust the left gate and associated rubbers, peg, and prim.  (rotated gate 2 degrees)
' v0.21 Backglass Flashers - Tied backglass flashers to solenoid 27 and 28, fade timers added and repositioned them to match real table. (leojreimroc)
' v2.0  Released version.  Slight adjustment to overall table lighting.

' Thank you to the VPW team, especially Tomate, AstroNasty, Sixtoe, PinStratsDan, Smaug, leojreimroc, and Rajo Joey for testing, feedback, and some updates!


' -------------------------------------------------
' IF YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE ISSUES or LOW FRAME RATE:
' -------------------------------------------------
' Try disabling "Reflect Elements On Playfield". This will increase performance for lesser powerful systems, and increase frame rate.
' Try turning off dynamic shadows.
' Turn off In-gmae AO, Post-proc AA, and 4xAA on the table objects
' Try to set some of the objects to "Static rendering". Open layer 7, select all screws and/or locknuts and select "Static Rendering" in the options windows
