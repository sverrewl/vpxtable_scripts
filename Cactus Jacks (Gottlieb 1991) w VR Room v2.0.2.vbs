'Cactus Jacks VPX table by bodydump and borgdog

'******** Revisions done by Borgdog and Bodydump on version 0.95 *********
' borgdog for creating the work on the 0.95 table
' bodydump for the initial working version with his great redraws of the playfield and plastics
' dark for all the cactus models, including the animations of the big 3 back cacti
' bord for all the lighting and shadow stuff he does that he did for this
' rothbauerw for his physics tutorial and updates and play testing and tweaking

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.0 by UnclePaulie *********
' - Added all the VR Cab primatives
' - Backglass Image from Wildman's B2S file
' - Added the alphanumeric displays from Class of 1812
' - Added a VR apron wall to block seeing through
' - Added two different VR room environments
' - Rails on left and right removed
' - Changed the plunger postion slightly to hit ball better
' - Increased size of the plunger cover for VR
' - Rotated the triggers in outlanes and top lanes by 180 degrees
' - Matched colors for flipper buttons to cabinet
' - Changed the ball image and added jp_scratches for decal to enhance the ball rolling realism
' - Added the five fruit flashers for the backglass
' - Changed GI Lights 1-9 to intensity=1.  It was 4, and was too bright.
' - Changed GI Lights 10-20 to intensity=1.  It was 6, and was too bright.
' - Implemented a fully animated backglass based on solenoid callouts.  Flashers on layer 11
' - Changed material on outer primitive to "Plastic with an image".  It was white plastic, and you could see through.
' - Animated the flipper buttons
' - Increased the day/night mode a couple ticks.
' - Changed a few sounds from fleep's sounds (bumper, flippers, slings, and coin in)

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.0 by Sixtoe *********
' - redid the cabinet artwork
' - fixed the ramps so they're transparent
' - unified nearly all the timers
' - dropped the plunger lane trigger
' - replaced the blade prim
' - changed the colour of the drop holes slightly
' - dropped the primitive flippers as they were too high
' - bumped the DL for the transparencies and dropped the DL for cabinet things

'******** Revisions done by UnclePaulie on Hybrid version 0.1 - 2.0 *********
' v0.1  Added hybrid mode for VR room, cabinet, and desktop
'     Added DTRails for left and right rails in desktop mode
' v0.2  Added Updated/more recent Rothbauerw/nFozzy physics and Flipper physics and Fleep Sounds
'     Added dynamic shadows solution to the solution created by iaakki, apophis, Wylte
'   Added GI relay sounds
'   Added knocker solenoid and position for sound
' v0.3  Added updated ramprolling sounds solution created by nFozzy and VPW
' v0.4  Changed to new droptargets and standup targets to solution created by Rothbauerw
'   Added VR clock
'     Increased the plunger pull speed slightly, and changed the mech strength and momemtum transfer
'   Corrected Drop target switches from original VPX table.  They were reverse order on the upper drops.
' v0.5  Added drop target shadows
'   Added a standup target shadow
'   Adjusted the length of the flippers down by 2 VP units, and slightly adjusted placement.
'   Also slight adjustment to top of sling pegs.
'   Adjusted the strength of the VUK near the top, as a couple times it wouldn't make it up the ramp.
'   Added 3 ball options, dark, bright, and brightest
'   Moved the day/night mode back a tick
' v0.6  Slight adjustment of the outerlane pegs to align better with playfield hole.
'   Adjusted heights of apron walls, and added several other invisible walls to block ball jumping over in corner conditions
'   Adjusted outer ramp pegs slightly to match close up pictures of a real table.
'   Readjusted flippers to match original size.
' v0.7  Changed tilt relay switch to 151.  It was set to 149 and never tilted.
'   Added drop ball sound when ball falls into the subway from UpperHoleTrigger
'   Changed desktop pov to see more of playfield
'   Several physics updates including bumper scatter angle, sling physics to z_sling, flipper physics updates to VPW recommendations.
'   Also updated the playfield friction to 0.22 form 0.25 (VPW recommend setting)
'   Changed the subway eject angle slightly to match the rollout to real table.
' v0.8  Changed all physics to zCol_xyz, insteand of the a_physics.  Walls, posts, sleeves, ramps, etc. Matched VPW recommendations.
' v0.9  Adjusted the peg and post under apron to turn them to be collidable with physics
'     Adjusted the right sling pegs, sling, and rubbers up slightly to better aling with playfield.  Helped issue with right outlane.
'   Added groove to plunger lane, and small ball release ramp to get up.  Had to increase strength of ballrelease from 8 to 12 to get up groove.
'   Changed the VR backglass general lamps to be controlled by the GI on or off, rather than game on/off
'   Dimmed the backglass in VR a little more to show lamps better
'   Added additional relay sounds to VR backglass
'   Adjusted some of the GI lights (10-20) back up in intensity to 3
'   Added new wood floor for VR with a shadow around trim
'     Adjusted the day/night cycle back to 2.5
' v0.10 Changed the backglass relay sounds to flash relay sounds
' v0.11 Completely changed the trough logic to handle balls on table
'   No longer destroy balls.  Use a global gBOT throughout all of script.
'   Removed all the getballs calls and am only useing gBOT.  Will help eliminate stutter on slower CPU machines
' v0.12 Ball would get stuck on bottom bumper and not go into subway.  Moved rail and it's physics wall slightly.
'   Corrected tnob to 2, and right sized the number of ball shadows
'   Code Cleanup
' v0.13 Added LUT options
'   Added other VR elements (power cord, optional posters, optional topper)
'   Corrected the tilt switch.  It wouldn't tilt in VR with switch 149 or 151.  Desktop worked, but not VR.  Changed to the GTS3.vbs defined SWTilt switch of -7... fixed it.
'   Slight adjustment of Wall15, above the plunger.  Spacing between the plunger and the ball was a bit too much gap.
' v0.14 Added an option for the cacti wobble on top of bumpers moving for slower systems to improve performance
' v0.15 Added rules sheet to table info
'   Adjusted digital nudge sensitivity and force
'   Testing by Rik, PinStratsDan, Apophis, and Wylte.
' v2.0  Release Version
' v2.0.1 Minor additional code to correct corner conditions where ball could get stuck behind bottom bumper and on left ramp
'    metalrail13 had a height a little too high, and was sticking above the ramp.  Reduced height from 75 to 50.
'    Added another wall block as a protector for other ball bounces.
' v2.0.2 Two non visible ramps had visibility checked.  Hard to see, but if you look close you can see...
'    Tomate created a new ramp object that is smoother to go up and around ramp.
'    Removed the code to block against it getting stuck on the ramp.  Shouldn't get stuck there anymore.

'****  DROP TARGETS by Rothbauerw
'******************************************************
' This solution improves the physics for drop targets to create more realistic behavior. It allows the ball
' to move through the target enabling the ability to score more than one target with a well placed shot.
' It also handles full drop target animation, including deflection on hit and a slight lift when the drop
' targets raise, switch handling, bricking, and popping the ball up if it's over the drop target when it raises.
'
' For each drop target, we'll use two wall objects for physics calculations and one primitive for visuals and
' animation. We will not use target objects.  Place your drop target primitive the same as you would a VP drop target.
' The primitive should have it's pivot point centered on the x and y axis and at or just below the playfield
' level on the z axis. Orientation needs to be set using Rotz and bending deflection using Rotx. You'll find a hooded
' target mesh in this table's example. It uses the same texture map as the VP drop targets.

' This part in the script is an entire block that is dedicated to the physics sound system.
' Various scripts and sounds that may be pretty generic and could suit other WPC systems, but the most are tailored specifically for the TOM table

' Many of the sounds in this package can be added by creating collections and adding the appropriate objects to those collections.
' Create the following new collections:
'   Metals (all metal objects, metal walls, metal posts, metal wire guides)
'   Apron (the apron walls and plunger wall)
'   Walls (all wood or plastic walls)
'   Rollovers (wire rollover triggers, star triggers, or button triggers)
'   Targets (standup or drop targets, these are hit sounds only ... you will want to add separate dropping sounds for drop targets)
'   Gates (plate gates)
'   GatesWire (wire gates)
'   Rubbers (all rubbers including posts, sleeves, pegs, and bands)
' When creating the collections, make sure "Fire events for this collection" is checked.
' You'll also need to make sure "Has Hit Event" is checked for each object placed in these collections (not necessary for gates and triggers).
' Once the collections and objects are added, the save, close, and restart VPX.
