' Williams's Solar Fire / IPD No. 2238 / July, 1981 / 4 Players
' VPX - version 1.2a by Goldchicco, 32assassin, and mfuegemann 2021, version 1.2a

'******** Revisions done by UnclePaulie on Hybrid version 1.2.01 - 2.0 *********
' v.01: Enabled hybrid code for desktop, VR, and cabinet modes
'   Created a new desktop mode backdrop
'   Removed displaytimer and added to frame timer
'   Updated LUT's to additional images, and new subroutines, and ability to save to user text file.
' v.02  Added VR Room elements, images, and materials.  Animated flippers and plunger.  Added room and clock options.
'   Adjusted cab pov
'   Changed the environment image and lighting
'   Moved the plunger forward slightly
'   Animated VR Backglass for Text info, and basic GI
'     Added lighter ball images provided by hauntfreaks and g5k ball scratches, changeable in script
'     Added the game over, BIP, etc. to the desktop backglass...
'   Added groove to plunger lane, and small ball release ramp to get up.
' v.03  Changed backbox and backglass to match real table size.
' v.04  Added Fleep Sounds, nFozzy / Roth physics and flippers.  Updated the flipper physics per recommendations.
'   Added code for DT, ST, slingshot corrections, flippers, physics, dampeners, shadows
'   Added flipper physics, and updated sizes.  Added updated Williams logo flipper prims.
'   Updated ramp, playfield, upper playfield physics
' v.05  Added Apophis sling corrections, and updated the physics.
'   Updated all elements physics and sound routines.
'   Removed Ramp6. It was doing nothing.
'   Added VPW Dynamic Ball Shadows to the solution done Iakki, Apophis, and Wylte
'   Instead of adding ramp triggers for ramp rolling sounds, I decided to have metal ramps have just a metal hit sound, since they were short.
'   Removed old "postwall's" and replaced with physics prims.
'   Raised all the plastic walls up 4 VP units.  The ball was hitting them rather than the rubbers.  Moved the screws up 4 VPU as well.
'   Also had to move up wall 19 by 4 VPUs.
' v0.6  Added new drop and standup targets to the solution done by Rothbauerw
'     Added updated knocker position and code
'   Adjusted color of sleeves
'   Changed flipper primitives to Williams logo
'   Edited Wall40 to transparent plastic.  Moved the vertical wall19 to better align, and made top transparent.
'   Moved the sw25 target significantly back (it was way to far forward.)  Also had to lengthen ramp 3 and 5
'   Added GI Relay Sound, LUT Click sound. Cleaned up other sounds.
' v0.7  Updated saucer / kicker logic with sub method and fleep sounds
'   Adjusted LeftEjectHole strength to be random.
' v0.8  Removed the UpperPFEnter kicker, as it destroyed balls.  I put a physics ramp prim in there from Bord's Black Knight.
'   Had to increase the plunger to physics to get up new ramp.
'   Watched videos and adjusted angle and stength to get the saucer roll outs as close as possible.
'   Adjusted end of wall 6 and wall 8 (needed to correct how ball rolled out.)
'   Adjusted the size of all the sleeves.  They were way too big.  Aligns better with playfield.  Able to fine tune rollouts from kickers.
' v0.9  Updated to 3 balls
'   The solar cannon plastic top needed to be moved up.
'   Moved all the plastic screws up, and aligned them with the posts.
'   Adjusted all rubbers size and height.  Also changed the height of slings.
' v0.10 Completely changed the trough logic to handle balls on table
'   Changed the apron wall structure to create a trough. Adjusted the plastics image for the new apron top.
'     No longer destroy balls.  Use a global gBOT throughout all of script.
'   Removed all the getballs calls and am only useing gBOT.  Will help eliminate stutter on slower CPU machines
'   Changed the outer walls to be a lighter wood (like real table... it was black)
'   Moved credit light
'   Changed side rails to redish/orange to match real table.  Also adjusted cabinet optional sideblades
' v0.11 Adjusted the apron and plunger plastics slightly. Removed plunger decal as well.
' v0.12 Removed soundtimer and flashertimer (not needed).
'   Aligned "match" text for desktop.
'   Set Trigger Height.
'   Adjusted side walls and cab to align better in all modes.
' v0.13 Added Drop Target Shadows
' v0.14 Adjusted some GI light sizes on top level... could see hanging over in VR.
'   Adjusted the playfield material to ensure active, and visible.
'   Modded the plastics2 image, and the associated walls to look better and align in VR better.
'   Replaced the post images and material with more realistic ones.
'   Removed Wall10.  It was doing nothing.
'   Slight adjustment to drop target postions for viewing in VR over new playfield holes.
'     Updated the playfield for slings, triggers holes, and target holes, and added plywood hole images.
'   Modified the sling primatives and sling walls to drop below playfield.  Looks better in VR.
' v0.15 Fixed the solar gun logic and subroutines, as it did NOT work previously.  Also removed one of the solargun kickers.
'   Removed wall005.  Wasn't doing anything.
' v0.16 Redid the solar gun button movement
'     Removed wall7. It was hiding the resting ball.
' v0.17 Animated the backglass in VR.
' v0.18 Updated to Lampz lighting routine by VPW, and modified the solenoid routines to accomodate.
'   Added GI to Lampz.
'   Added basic ball GI brightness level.
'   Added varying Lampz aLvl brightness fade levels for backglass lamps, and playfield flashers.
'   Also added GI to white screws, rubbbers, posts, apron, plunger, side walls, and targets (each target needed separate material since active)
'   Added new Williams flipper primitives and had added GI levels to them.
'   Changed halo height of GI to .1 and increased default bulb intensity scale to 2
' v0.19 Added updated playfield and insert text for 3D inserts.  Needed both upper and lower playfield inserts.
'   Adjusted all the insert light intensities, fade, falloff, heights, colors, etc.
'   Adjusted the 3,5,10 second prims to 100 intensity to see through
'   Added insert light blooms
'   Added GI Brightness increase to inserts when GI is off and reduced it when GI on.
' v0.20 Added VR backwall, cleaned up some VR stuff.
'   Redid the solarcannon wall, trigger and saucer position.  Looked wierd in VR, and made it play better (you can hit the button a little easier)
'   Adjusted the credit light prim light, location
'   Changed the depth bias of the upper playfield text ramp to -100... had an issue where it "overwrote" parts of the playfied.
'   Changed how the 3,5, and 10 seconds inserts looked.  Original playfield had them black and green letters.  Really a blue insert.
'   Set alpha channel on text overlays to 50.  Made the text on inserts look so much better.
'   Adjusted the center V insert brightness to be more white when off
'     Moved the shoot again text on the insert
'   Changed the SolarGunTriggerButton trigger to a star to trigger movement better in VR.
'     Updated POV for cab
' v0.21 Updated shadow code for prior bug found, as well as top playfield ball shadows (thanks Wylte!)
'   Widened the outlanes slightly based on some feedback from apophis and pinstratsdan. Was too easy before.
'   Moved the lower flippers slightly as well.  And increased strength to 1780
'   Added GI to the sleeves
' v0.22 Adjusted the flipper end angle per apophis recommendation.
'   Adjusted the intensity of the credit light down
'   Adjustment of flipper physics slightly and set strength to 1850.
'   Added SoundFX call to SoundFlipperUpAttackLeft and SoundFlipperUpAttackRight
'   Adjusted the LeftEjectHole roll out to match game play.  Also the solar left wall roll out.
' v0.23 All a visible wall block under the apron to ensure you can't see through.
' v0.24 Added playfield mesh for the saucers to have a realistic bevel for falling.
'   Also added nicer looking Williams gray kicker primitives.
' v0.25 Added an upper playfield mesh for the saucers
' v0.26 Final tweaking of all 3 saucer walls for correct play with new mesh.
' v2.0  Released Version
' v2.01 Added ball rolling to top playfield.  Missed in earlier testing
'   Updated plastics to remove blur.  Thanks to JasonDH for the suggestion and the new image.
' v2.02 Changed the anti-biff snubbers behind flippers to be a cylinder primitive instead of rail. Raised physical apron wall. (Thanks Rothbauerw)
' v2.03 Added flipper tricks to top flippers.
'   Added a VR grill for backbox and Backrail
'   Removed an UpdateTrough call from solenoid ballrelease and outhole (added to drain hit and unhit).  Just in case it had a timing issue with release other balls.
' v2.04 Disabled screen space reflections and in game AO.
' v2.05 Updated the plastics to all be collidable.  There were a couple reports that the ball jumped onto the top of plastic and fell in.
'   Added one physcis plastic wall between ramps, and an apron wall to block any jumped shots.
'   Worked with Rothbauerw on the trough logic. Made the Drain kicker larger and moved slightly, changed speed of trough timer to go faster
'   Added a delay to when the drain switch changes state. Essentially the Outhole solenoid is too fast, and the trough couldn't be updated fast enough.
'   Slight adjustment to saucer physical primitives.
